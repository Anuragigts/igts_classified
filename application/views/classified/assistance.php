												<div id="one" class="panel-collapse collapse in" role="tabpanel" >
													<div class="panel-body">
														<p><strong>Ask Questions</strong> : Articulate your curiosity in the product and ask any questions you may have on your first contact with the seller by phone or email. Ask about the condition and/or history of the product. You may request for photographs as well.</p>
														<p><strong>Personal Information Should Be Limited</strong> : You must share a limited amount of information about yourself (for example, information like your home phone number or address is not required and amputate personal information from your email sig file). However, if your questions have been answered and the seller seems plausible, more information about yourself, such as your name and cell phone number might be required by the seller (but keep it limited to that).</p>
														<p><strong>Establish The Credibility Of The Seller</strong> : We highly recommend the use of more personal ways of communication (for example, talking on the phone or meeting personally) in addition to exchanging emails. If at any point during the initial contact process the seller does not seem to be plausible enough or sceptical in any way, stop the transaction immediately.</p>

														<p><strong>Hold Meeting in a public place</strong> : Meet the seller, preferably during daytime in a public place when other people are likely to be around.</p>
														<p><strong>Bring Along A Friend </strong> : In case you need to visit the home of the seller it is recommended that you always inform someone where you are going, share the contact information of the seller (their email address, phone number) and/or bring a friend along with you. If at any point during the meeting process the seller does not seem to be plausible enough or sceptical in any way, you may simply excuse yourself.</p>

														<p><strong>Do The Research</strong> : To know that you are not paying unreasonably you must do an advanced research on the market price of the product you are buying. To support your negotiation you may also bring your references. Although the prices are negotiable, do not insult the seller with an unreasonably low offer.</p>
														<p><strong>See It, Before Paying For It </strong> - It is advisable to see the item personally before buying it. Inspect the condition of the merchandise carefully. In case of a vehicle, check its history carefully and ask for receipts for service records, if any. An inspection of the vehicle at a local mechanic before you buy it is advisable and will help you identify potential safety and mechanical issues. Ensure that the car is registered in the seller's name and take the car on a test drive for extra precaution. Check the veterinary records and pedigree papers in case of a pet.</p>

												<div id="four" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" >

														<p><strong>Cash Payments</strong>  : Paying  cash is the simplest and safest mode of payment in on-line classifieds. Do not use Western Union, money wires, personal checks or Money grams. Refrain from sharing personal information such as Debit or Credit Card details.</p>
												
														<p><strong>Use Cashier's Checks For Big Payments :</strong>  In case of big purchases, carrying a cashier's check of a well known bank is more comfortable than carrying cash. It is advisable to thoroughly ensure that you are buying the product and finalize the amount before presenting the check. Always ask for a signed receipt.</p>
														
														<p><strong>Protecting Personally Identifiable Information</strong> : Do not share your bank numbers, credit card numbers, National Insurance number, etc. If asked for your National Insurance number by a landlord for instance, give them a copy of your credit report instead, with your National Insurance number .If at any point during the transaction process the seller does not seem to be plausible enough or sceptical in any way, stop the transaction immediately. Always trust your instincts. </p>

									<h3>Buying Safely</h3>
									<p><strong>You should be well aware of the signs of a deceitful seller to buy safely online. Some of the things that you should look out for are:</strong></p> 	
									<p>When the price of an item is way below the normal market price, you have a strong reason to double check everything.</p> 	
									<p>The classified ads on <strong> <a href="http://99rightdeals.com/" target="_blanks">99 RightDeals</a> </strong> is required to have a valid phone number. In case of a valid phone number missing, send us an Email so that we can look into the matter for you.</p> 	
									<p><strong> <a href="http://99rightdeals.com/" target="_blanks">99 RightDeals</a> </strong> provides service only to people living in U.K. Sellers from outside U.K. are not permitted to sell items on <strong> <a href="http://99rightdeals.com/" target="_blanks">99 RightDeals</a> </strong>.</p> 	
									<p>It is important that you inspect the item before making any kind of payment to the seller, especially in case of expensive items like bikes cars and caravans. If, for whatever reasons, you are not able to do so, walk away from the deal.</p> 	
									<p>Payment methods such as Wire cash transfer, including services like Money Gram and Western Union and transfers from overseas bank accounts are prohibited payment methods on <strong> <a href="http://99rightdeals.com/" target="_blanks">99 RightDeals</a> </strong>. We suggest that you should avoid using these services to make payments to other buyers and sellers. We discourage you to do so because after sending funds through these services, there is no way the money can be retrieved, in case if something goes wrong. It is better to pay through a familiar, safe and easily traceable payment method. PayPal can be used, however, they should be verified PayPal member and should have a positive online reputation. (Note: Do not fall under an assumption that a payment at PayPal is 100% safe. If you have not received an item, PayPal does not reimburse your money. However, it's an exception if you buy an eligible item from eBay directly)</p> 	
									<p>Neither <strong> <a href="http://99rightdeals.com/" target="_blanks">99 RightDeals</a> </strong>, nor Facebook or PayPal provides a service where your payments will be on hold until the item has been successfully shipped. There's an option of escrow services, but that cannot be relied on either as scammers can sometimes pretend to be one, we suggest you research well on the escrow services before putting in your faith in it.</p>

													</h3>
												</div>
												<div id="five" class="panel-collapse collapse in" role="tabpanel" >
													<div class="panel-body">
														<p><strong>Use more photos and describe your product well</strong> : When you describe your product properly and give out complete information, the buyer is less likely to be disappointed after seeing the item in person. The photographs help form the correct notion in the minds of the buyers, try to use them as much as you can.</p>
														<p><strong>Avoid giving out personal information</strong> : We suggest that you give out information that does not personally identify you. It is better to give a mobile phone number rather than a home one. Similarly, avoid giving work email address and give a Yahoo, G mail or Hot mail email id instead. </p>
														<p>Be straightforward in your approach, whether it is answering questions of the potential buyers or finding any sort of information that might help the individual whom you are renting or selling.</p>

													</h3>
												</div>
												<div id="six" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" >
													<div class="panel-body">
														<p><strong>Address the questions</strong> : Make sure you respond to questions of the buyers who are showing interest in your item. You can do that over the phone or email. Move forward only when you're sure that you want to do business with that individual, and that you find him credible and trustworthy enough.</p>
														<p><strong>Don't give your personal details</strong> ; Even while having initial talks about your item, please avoid giving out information that is personally identifiable; information like your workplace, home address etc. Do that only after you are comfortable enough with the other person. Inviting someone to your residence should strictly be avoided.</p>
														<p>Listen to your instincts. When you feel that buyer is acting suspicious in any way, choose to walk away from the deal.</p>

													</h3>
												</div>
												<div id="seven" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" >
													<div class="panel-body">
														<p><strong>Avoid meeting alone, have a company; meet in a public place</strong> : Try your best to have a meeting in a public place. In case, if the item can't be carried around (like a furniture or a washing machine), ensure that you have a friend or a relative over at your place when the potential buyer visits to see your item. Schedule your showings all at one time if you are alone at home, the more crowded it is, the safer. Also, let people in your neighbourhood know that some potential buyers are visiting your place.</p>
														<p><strong>Choose to do business with local people</strong> - Accept offers from people who you can meet in person. Locally done classified transactions are much better. Don't be tempted by offers over your asking price. A common scam that we have observed is that an offer is made over the asking price with the additional shipping amount. The fraud buyer sends a counterfeit cashier's check and asks for the refund of the difference amount. When you realise that the cashier's check is counterfeit, it's already too late.</p>
														<p><strong>Get ready for the negotiations</strong> - When you meet the buyer, the negotiation on the price of the item, and terms of transactions are bound to happen. Ensure that you know you're the value of your item and where it stands in the market.</p>
														<p><strong>When sold, remove it from the listings</strong> - It will save you and buyers a lot of time and energy if you remove the ad as soon as your item is sold. This will avoid buyer's wastage of time and you unwanted queries of the item you have sold already.</p>
														<p>Ask the buyer to leave from your house if he/she seems suspicious, or makes you feel uncomfortable at any given point in the meeting, walk away if you're meeting the buyer somewhere in public.</p>
														<p>We, at <strong> <a href="http://99rightdeals.com/" target="_blanks">99 RightDeals</a> </strong> do not provide any kind of transaction assistance like " Bill Of Sale ". Though eBay does have a Vehicle Protection Program, but that is applicable to the items that are directly purchased from eBay.</p>

												</div>
												<div id="eight" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" >
													<div class="panel-body">
														<p><strong>Ask for Cash</strong> - Doing transactions in cash is most convenient for both parties. Ask the buyer to pay in full. Say no to payment methods like Western Union, Money grams, Money wires or personal checks. Also, avoid giving identifiable information such as credit card numbers or bank information.</p>
														<p><strong>Accept cashier's check, in case of big purchases</strong> - It is understood that buyers will not be comfortable carrying big amounts in cash for items priced higher. The best alternative is to visit the bank together and get a cashier's check arranged that will be written out to you. Cashier's checks are easy to forge, hence we suggest you to avoid taking it from someone's pocket. Get the authenticity of check verified by visiting the bank during business hours.</p>
														<p><strong>Protect your identity</strong> - Make sure that you don't give away information like credit card number, National Insurance number, bank numbers, etc.</p>
														<p>On successful completion of transaction, don't forget to offer a receipt. Mention in detail about the amount of the transaction and the item's condition in which you have sold it to the buyer, should the further disputes arise. Ensure that there's a signature of both parties on it, and copy of that receipt is with you. This should be done specially in case of car/bike sale. This receipt might be required later as a proof that you have let go of the responsibilities and ownership of the vehicle if the re-registration process has not been done and the vehicle gets involved in a an accident, or gets a ticket.</p>

									<h3>Selling Safely</h3>
									<p><strong>There are some common signs of a deceitful buyer, that you should always watch out for. Here are few of them:</strong></p>
									<p>Buyers from outside U.K. are not allowed to use <strong> <a href="http://99rightdeals.com/" target="_blanks">99 RightDeals</a> </strong>. If a buyer from different part of the world contacts you, please report it to us along with the details. </p>
									<p>If the buyer is too courteous and offers to pay more than what you asked, you have a big reason not to trust the buyer. </p>
									<p>If the buyer can only be contacted through email and no other source, we suggest to avoid transacting. Often, sellers receive SMS from buyers with numbers that are invalid. You should be careful in such cases. </p>
									<p>If you're told by the buyer that payments has been made through PayPal, the best way to confirm it is by logging into your account and seeing it for yourself. Often, fake confirmation emails are created and sent to the seller to create the notion that payment has been made. Also, please be extra cautious when high value items like a bike or a car is involved, and when a buyer wants the item to be shipped overseas and wants you to pay for it. </p>
									<p>Always choose to send your items through a registered post. You should be able to track the item if the buyer claims that they have not received the item. </p>
									<p>Always be alert when it comes to check payments. Banks can take some time to notify you that the check you deposited was a fake one. To be on safer side you should go to the bank with the buyer and get the cashier's check issued in person. Make sure you don't send a portion of the money back to the shipping agent, buyer or any other person. </p>
									
									<h3>Reporting Scams</h3>
									<p>If you find anything suspicious on <strong> <a href="http://99rightdeals.com/" target="_blanks">99 RightDeals</a> </strong>, send us an email. If you see an ad that looks fraud or a scam, if you receive a phishing email or if an overseas Buyer or Seller tried to contact you, it is best that you report it to us. If in case you have been cheated or have been a victim of a fraud, report it to us right away and also file a report to the police.</p>

													<div class="panel-body">
														<p>Often, scammers put up tempting ads online, selling items at a much lower price. These deceitful sellers claim to be living locally, but are actually outside country. Once you pay the money to these people for that low cost item, neither they nor the transactions are traced.</p>
														<p><strong>Protecting yourself from such frauds</strong> - You should be very careful when you see items priced way lower than market price. If you're asked to transfer money from services like Western Union, you should refuse straight away. Speak to the seller on phone and see the item for yourself before making any kind of payments.</p>

												</div>
												<div id="comtwo" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" >
													<div class="panel-body">
														<p>The execution of SMS scam is quite similar to online scams, with a difference being that scammers contact sellers, through a SMS, usually using an international number. They show that they're keen on the item you're selling and tell you that they'll pay you through PayPal and get the item shipped in their country. You receive an email from their end that appears genuine, confirming that the payments have been made. The email might also ask you to make payments for shipping through a link provided in it. Once you make that payment, the buyer and payment disappear.</p>
														<p><strong>Protecting yourself from such frauds</strong> - Simply deal with sellers and buyers that reside in U.K. In case you receive an SMS from a buyer outside U.K., email us. We suggest you to report that SMS to us, before responding it.</p>
